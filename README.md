# Security Protocols
 This repository contains implementations of cryptographic concepts as part of the Security Protocols course at Tampere University. The tasks cover encryption, decryption, and security analysis of various cryptographic techniques:  Tutorial 1 - Classical Ciphers Caesar Cipher: Encryption, decryption, brute-force attack analysis. Double Caesar Cipher: Double encryption approach and security evaluation. Affine Cipher: Mathematical transformation-based encryption and decryption. Frequency Analysis: Statistical attack on substitution ciphers. Tutorial 2 - Hashing and Cryptographic Integrity (not included in this repository, assumed background knowledge) Tutorial 3 - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Digital Signatures: Implement SHA-256-based message signing and verification. Certificate Authority (CA): Set up a root CA, issue and sign certificates. Website Security with Certificates: Secure a local web server with self-signed certificates and analyze encrypted traffic. Email Security: Generate and use digital certificates for encrypted and signed emails.
